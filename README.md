Movie & TV Show Trends App
Welcome to the Movie & TV Show Trends App! This application allows users to explore trending movies and TV shows, view detailed information about them, and save their favorites. Built with Vite and Vanilla JavaScript, it leverages the TMDB API to fetch and display up-to-date content.

How It Works
1. Fetching Data
The app uses the TMDB API to fetch data about movies or TV shows.

API requests are made using fetch and are dynamically updated based on user interactions.

2. Rendering Content
Data fetched from the API is rendered dynamically using JavaScript.

The app uses template literals to generate HTML content for each movie or TV show.

3. Local Storage
Favorites are stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to revisit their saved items even after closing the app.

4. Routing
The app uses URL parameters to navigate between different views (e.g., details page, search results).

5. Dynamic Filtering
The app filters out irrelevant content (e.g., actors) and only displays movies and TV shows.
